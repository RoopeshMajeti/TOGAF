TOGAF - Session-2

Core concepts of TOGAF :
=====================

Architecture landscape, Building blocks. 
These are frequently used during ADM.


Every enterprise will have an arch landscape.
Arch landscape is/can be divided into 3 parts :

	Strategic level Architecture:	 
		Enterprise level Arch. 
			Example : Citibank.
	Segment level Architecture	: 
		Portfolio level Architecture. 
			Example: Loans, Cards, Investment.
	Capability level Architecture: 
		Project level Architecture. 
			Example : Personal Loans/Business Loans/Home Loans)

Architecture partitioning :
	Breadth, Time, Maturity	 	

Architecture landscape/partitioning happens at the preliminary phase.



Building blocks :
================
Characters :
	re-usable components.
	They can be easily replaced/reused
	They are Interdependent and dependent.

Two type sof building blocks
	Architecture building blocks and Solution building blocks.

C182 : Chapter 33 ( Building blocks ). 


Part Two : Architecture Development Method.
==========================================

	Iterative in nature
	LifeCycle :
		Can customize ADM as per Org needs
		Does not need to go through entire life cycle.
		Can use few or all phases of ADM.
	Step by step approach to develop EA.

	Every phase will have 
		Objectives, Steps, Inputs and outputs.

ADM Phases : A, B, C(I), D(T), E(O), F(M), G(G), H(I)

Arch capability is the arch function/practice.

Preliminary phase helps in preparation and initiation activities to setup the Architecture capability.


Phase A initiates upon receiving of Request-For-Arch-Work.


Part 3:  ADM Guidelines and Techniques :
======================================

Guidelines :
---------- 
	How to iterate the ADM
	How to apply ADM to Architecture landscape
	Security considerations.

The above are supporting the application of ADM.


Techniques :
----------
	Stakeholder mgmt
	Risk mgmt
	Readiness Assessment
	Identifying Requirements



Part 4: Architecture content framework :
======================================
Provides a comprehensive cheklist of all outputs in ADM phases.

Content -> Output = workproduct.

Three categorizes viz., Deliverables, Artifacts and Building blocks.

	Deliverables :
		Statement of Architecture work ( SOAW )
		Architecture Definition Documents ( ADD )
		Obligated Documents.

	Artifacts :	Describe an aspect of an architecture
		Catalogues : List of things.
		Matrices : Relationship of things.
		Diagrams : Picture of things

	Building Blocks :
		Potentially reusable components ( ABB & SBB )
